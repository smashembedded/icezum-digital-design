## About the IceZUM Alhambra

<img src="docs/images/icezumAlhambra.jpeg" width="480" alt="IceZUM Alhambra" />

The IceZUM Alhambra is an open-source FPGA development board designed with education and accessibility in mind. It is based on the Lattice iCE40HX1K and was created as part of the [FPGAwars](https://fpgawars.github.io/) initiative, which aims to promote open hardware and digital design education.

If you're curious about the hardware design and background, check out the original project repository:
[FPGAwars / IceZUM-Alhambra](https://github.com/FPGAwars/icezum)

## Required Software Installation

### Icarus Verilog
[Icarus](https://bleyer.org/icarus/) is a free compiler implementation for the IEEE-1364 Verilog hardware description language.
Download and install the next version [iverilog-v12-20220611-x64_setup](https://bleyer.org/icarus/iverilog-v12-20220611-x64_setup.exe). 


### Apio
[Apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio) is an open source ecosystem for open FPGA boards. Is a multiplatform toolbox, with static pre-built packages, project configuration tools and easy command interface to verify, synthesize, simulate and upload verilog dsigns.

```bash
pip install -U apio
apio install -all
```

---

## Quick Start

* Check your verilog code using [Icarus Verilog](https://bleyer.org/icarus/).
```bash
apio verify
```
* Simulate your test bench using [Icarus Verilog](https://bleyer.org/icarus/) and [GTKWave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)
```bash
apio sim
```
* Syntesize your project using [Icestorm Tools](https://clifford.at/icestorm)
```bash
apio build
```
* Enable FTDI drivers
```bash
apio drivers --ftdi-enable

Launch drivers configuration tool

   FTDI driver installation:
   Usage instructions

      1. Connect the FTDI FPGA board
      2. Select (Interface 0)
      3. Replace driver by "libusbK"
      4. Reconnect the board
      5. Check `apio system --lsftdi`
```

<img src="docs/images/interface1.png" width="480" alt="Interface1" />
<img src="docs/images/successfully.png" width="480" alt="Drivers Successfully Installed" />

* Connect your FPGA board and upload the bitstream using [Icestorm Tools](https://clifford.at/icestorm)
```bash
apio upload
```

## Dependencies

Make sure the following components are properly installed through Apio and your system's package manager:

| Tool           | Description                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Apio CLI**   | FPGA workflow management        |
| **Icestorm**   | open-source Lattice toolchain   |
| **Icarus Verilog** | Simulator & compiler        |
| **GTKWave**    | Waveform viewer (optional)      |
